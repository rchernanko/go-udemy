Why Go:

- Efficient compilation:
	- go creates compiled programs
		- there is a garbage collector
 		- there is no virtual machine
- Efficient execution
- Ease of programming
- Fast growing programming language

Context:

- In 2005-2006, the first commercially available dual-core processors (i.e. multiple CPUs) became available for consumers
- Up until that time, every programming language was built to take advantage of a single-core processor (single CPU)
- GoLang was created to take advantage of multiple cores (multiple CPUs) and to do concurrency and parallelism really easily

- Google felt that no other programming languages were meeting their needs
- They hired some 'visionaries' to build a new language and version 1 was released in 2012
- Lots more info on why Google created a new language here - https://golang.org/doc/faq#What_is_the_purpose_of_the_project
- TODO read the above

What is Go good for?

- Web services at scale
- networking (http, tcp, udp)
- concurrency / parallelism
- systems
- automation command line tools
- crypto
- many other things too

Guiding principles of GoLang design:

- Expressive, comprehensible, sophisticated
- clean, clear, easy to read
- https://golang.org/doc/faq#principles
- TODO read the above
