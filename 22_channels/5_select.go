		Note re: why don't i need to close the e and o channels.
		"You needn't close every channel when you've finished with it. It's only necessary to close a channel when it
		is important to tell the receiving goroutines that all data have been sent. A channel that the garbage collector
		determines to be unreachable will have its resources reclaimed whether or not it is closed."

		"Closing a channel indicates that no more values will be sent on it. This can be useful to communicate completion to the channelâ€™s receivers."
