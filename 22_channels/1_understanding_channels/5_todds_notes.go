Channels Introduction
	- making a channel
		c := make(chan int)
	- putting values on a channel
		c <- 42
	- taking values off of a channel
		<-c

- buffered channels
	c := make(chan int, 4)

- channels block!
	- they are like runners in a relay race
	- they are synchronized
		- they have to pass/receive the value at the same time
			just like runners in a relay race have to pass / receive the baton to each other at the same time
			- one runner canâ€™t pass the baton at one moment
			- and then, later, have the other runner receive the baton
			- the baton is passed/received by the runners at the same time
			- the value is passed/received synchronously; at the same time

- channels allow us to pass values between goroutines

//TODO read the documentation on channels in the language specification and in effective go
