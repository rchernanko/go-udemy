	Godoc.org actually has documentation for standard and 3rd party libraries

		One thing that you can see when reviewing the docs for fmt.Println is that it's signature allows for variadic
		parameters to be passed in

		func Println(a ...interface{}) (n int, err error)

		So we c an do stuff like this:

	*/

	strings := []string{"richard", "learning", "go"}

	fmt.Println("hello", 34, false, strings)

	/*

		After running go run <file_name>...

		hello 34 false [richard learning go]

		To use the Println's returns:

	*/

	n, err := fmt.Println("returns")

	fmt.Println(n) //prints 8 (number of bytes written)

	if err == nil {
		fmt.Println(err)                                  //prints <nil>
		fmt.Println("no errors in the Println execution") //gets printed
	}

	n, _ = fmt.Println("not needed the err")

	fmt.Println(n) //19

	   Key points covered in this video:

	   - variadic parameters
	      	- the “...<some type>” is how we signify a variadic parameter
	      	- the type “interface{}” is the empty interface
	   		- every value is also of type “interface{}”
	      	- so the parameter “...interface{}” means “give me as many arguments of any type as you’d like

	   - throwing away returns
	      	- use the “_” underscore character to throw away returns

	   - you can’t have unused variables in your code
	   	- this is code pollution
	      	- the compiler doesn’t allow it

	   - we use this notation in Go
	      	- package.Identifier
	   	- ex: fmt.Println()
	      		- we would read that: “from package fmt I am using the Println func”
	      	- an identifier is the name of the variable, constant, func

	   - packages
	      	- code that is already written which you can use
	      	- imports
