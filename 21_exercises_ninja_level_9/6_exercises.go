/*

- go run

$ go run 6_exercises.go
Arch is: amd64
OS is: darwin

- go build

$ go build 6_exercises.go
Builds the binary which we can then run with ./6_exercises and this prints out
Arch is: amd64
OS is: darwin

- go install

	- should add the binary to my gopath > bin
	- and from then anywhere, you can just run 6_exercises and the binary will execute
	- but when i tried to do a go install from here, i couldn't - got the following error message:

		go install: no install location for directory /Users/richardchernanko/Development/go-udemy/21_exercises_ninja_level_9 outside GOPATH
        For more details see: 'go help gopath'
