- He wants to emphasise how important it is to be able to read the documentation (fair point)
- So in this tutorial, we do exactly that for switch statements
- https://golang.org/ref/spec#Switch_statements

- So far, we have only covered "expression switches"

	"In an expression switch, the cases contain expressions that are compared against the value of the switch expression"

And some more documentation over at effective go:

- https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#switch
- https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#type_switch
