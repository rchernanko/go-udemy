/**

- Again, he stresses that the language specification and effective go are the top 2 go-to places
- All go official documentation is listed here:
	https://golang.org/doc/

- Golang.org Vs Godoc.org
	- Golang.org lists package documentation for packages in the Go standard library only
	- Godoc.org lists package documentation for third party libraries as well as standard go library packages
		- So e.g. I will find FUNK package documentation at godoc.org but not at golang.org
