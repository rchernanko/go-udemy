What is bcrypt?

- If you're storing passwords anywhere, bcrypt is an excellent way of storing password information
- As soon as you receive a password from e.g. a user registration, you can use bcrypt to encrypt it, store the
encrypted value + then you never even know the value of that password
- When you then receive a password from e.g. a user login, you run it through bcrypt and then you can compare the value
with the value you have stored
- The basics of encryption are taking a value, and jumbling it all up. You only ever want to store an encrypted version
of user's passwords

Go implementation of bcrypt:
- https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt
- Interestingly, the "x" package here is basically some go code that is more experimental and has not yet made it into
the standard library
